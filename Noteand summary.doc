My portfolio wesite contains all required sections
Day night toggle switch is not in my portfolio website as I dont know how to apply that , I tried but not able to do so.
I have total 5 html files and 5 css files in project.
Used total 25 photos and 4 documents.
I had shared my personal info in project including my social media handles and contact details.I trust that it is safe.
My Portfolio website theme is based on 2 colors majorly One navy{darkshade} and sky blue {As it is}.
I also added the preview video.
Hope Sir/Mam you will like my project.
Hoping a positive feedback from your side,Thanks..
